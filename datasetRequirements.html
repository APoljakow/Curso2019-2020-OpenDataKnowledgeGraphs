  <h3>Requirements satisfied</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>R1. Data is in the smart city domain.</h4>
      <p>The dataset shows the <b>wi-fi spot distribution</b> in New York city, which is one of the
      available domains to be covered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>R2. Data is available as a CSV file.</h4>
      <p>Every file in the dataset has a CSV format.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>R3. Data has an open license so it can be published.</h4>
      <p>The dataset has an open license, as it's stated below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h4>
      <p>The dataset has many entities that can be linked, as it's stated below.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>License</h3>
