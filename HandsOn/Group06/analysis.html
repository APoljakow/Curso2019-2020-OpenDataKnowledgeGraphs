        <h4>Dataset analysis</h4>
        
        //TODO

    <br>
    <p>
        <h4>License analysis for selected datasets</h4>
        
        The first 2 datasets have PPDL license. You are free:<br>
        •	To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.<br>
        •	To Create: To produce works from the database.<br>
        •	To Adapt: To modify, transform and build upon the database.<br>
        As long as you:<br>
        •	Blank: This section is intentionally left blank. The PDDL imposes no restrictions on your use of the PDDL licensed database.<br>
        Source: https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/<br><br>

        The license of the third dataset is more restrictive: Motivate hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited, perpetual license to access, reproduce, analyze, copy, modify, distribute in your product or service and use the Data for any lawful purpose (“License”). <br>
        Prohibited Conduct: Host, stream, publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell the Data as a stand-alone dataset; provided, however, you may include the Data as source material, as applicable, in analyses, reports, or studies published or distributed for non-commercial purposes. <br>
        However, as stated above, we are able to use the dataset as source material in our analysis.<br>

    <br>
    <p>
        <h4>License for produced datasets</h4>
        
        The license for the work to be produced aims at being as open as possible. Thus, our license mimics the stictest one we are using at the moment, that is here reproduced again:<br><br>
        <i> 
            This license hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited, perpetual license to access, reproduce, analyze, copy, modify, distribute in your product or service and use the Data for any lawful purpose (“License”). <br>
            Prohibited Conduct: Host, stream, publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell the Data as a stand-alone dataset; provided, however, you may include the Data as source material, as applicable, in analyses, reports, or studies published or distributed for non-commercial purposes. <br>
            However, as stated above, we are able to use the dataset as source material in our analysis.
        </i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h4>Naming strategy</h4>
        According to the principles of Linked Open Data and to the best practices for URIs by well-established guides, we opted for the following naming strategy:
        <br><br>
        •	According to the Cool URIs guide [Sauermann and Cyganiak, 2008], hash URIs will be used since our dataset and our onotology are, at the moment, rather small.
        <br><br>
        •	The URI domain chosen is <i>www.bostonbikenetwork.com</i>; we opted for that since it is under our direct control (potentially: it is available, but we didn't actually purchase it. We will consider it as it were ours for the purpose of these assignments).
        <br><br>
        •	Ontology model for classes: the classes of the ontology will have the form of:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/ontology/&lt;ontologyName&gt;#&lt;className&gt;</i><br>
        
&nbsp    An example for the class Bike in the bike ontology could be:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/ontology/BikeOntology#Bike<br></i>
        <br>
        •	Ontology model for properties: the properties of the ontology will have the form of:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/ontology/&lt;ontologyName&gt;#&lt;propertyName&gt;</i><br>

&nbsp        An example for the property hasID of the Bike class in the bike ontology could be:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/ontology/BikeOntology#hasID<br></i>
        <br>
        •	Instances model: the instances in the ontology will have the form of:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/resource/&lt;className&gt;#&lt;identifier&gt;</i><br>
        
&nbsp        An example for the instance of a bike with ID <i>1ur8f42f7</i> could be:<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>       www.bostonbikenetwork.com/resource/Bike#1ur8f42f7</i><br>
&nbsp       It is important to be noted that the ID naming strategy is independent from the URI naming strategy, and that individual URIs are independent, from a strict point of view, from class URIs.
