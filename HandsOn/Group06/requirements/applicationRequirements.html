            <h4>Description of the application user interface</h4>
            We aim to use Open Data of the City of Boston about the bike network, stations and trips in order to create an application for the user: a person who wants to ride a bike in Boston. 
            The application should have a map with the bikeways available, the estimated traffic in those, the locations of BlueBike stations, and how many bikes/parking spots are available in each station.
